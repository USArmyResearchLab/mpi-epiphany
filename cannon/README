Compile and run as root ($ sudo -i)

Uses default definitions found in the top of the Makefile

$ make
$ ./main.x

NOTES:

One must take care to balance the work across cores with
appropriate values for the following command line args.

COMMAND LINE:

-n [on-chip matrix dimension]
	This is the on-chip matrix size (typically up to 128
	for Epiphany III or up to 256 for Epiphany IV)

-s [off-chip scale factor]
	This value is the amount of off-chip blocks to use.
	Setting -n 128 and -s 2, will perform a 256x256
	matrix multiply.  Use -s 1 for default.

-s2 [host scale factor]
	This value is the amount of host blocks to use.
	Setting -n 128, -s 12, and -s2 2, will perform a
	3072x3072 matrix multiply.  The s2 host scale factor
	should only be used when the problem exceeds the 32 MB
	of shared memory (typically, problems larger than
	1536x1536).

-d [eCore dimension]
	This is the dimension of the 2D eCore array (typically
	4 for Epiphany III or 8 for Epiphany IV).  You may use
	less than the number of cores available but is the
	behavior is undefined when using more.

-v
	Verbose output

-h, --help
	Lists help for commands

Example uses:

./main.x
	Uses default definitions found in the top of the Makefile

./main.x -n 128 -s 1 -d 4
	Performs a 128x128 matrix multiply with each eCore in a
	4x4 core array getting a 32x32 block

./main.x -n 128 -s 2 -d 4
	Performs a 256x256 matrix multiply with each eCore in a
	4x4 core array getting a 32x32 block. Additional values
	load from shared memory (performance takes a hit)

./main.x -n 96 -s 1 -d 3
	Performs a 96x96 matrix multiply with a block of 3x3
	eCores getting a 32x32 block.  The remaining cores do
	not participate in the calculation

./main.x -n 128 -s 12 -s2 2 -d 4
	Performs a 3072x3072 matrix multiply with each eCore in a
	4x4 core array getting a 32x32 block. Additional values
	load from shared and main memory.
